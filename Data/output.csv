Be as specific as you need and let our filters do the work.

With our huge network of sellers and cars, we make it easy to compare and track the cars you like, plus get vehicle info and condition reports (when available) along the way. Want to know if the price listed on a car is a good deal or not?  Look for the Good Price or Great Price green badge in the top right corner of the listing.

WHAT IS HALLOW
Hallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio-guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our Christian faith & spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 6,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Holy Bible readings, music, and more.

In today’s world, we’re stressed, anxious, distracted, and often sleep-deprived. At the same time, we’re searching for deeper meaning, purpose & relationships. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in Heaven is the goal :)

WhatsApp Business enables you to have a business presence on WhatsApp, communicate more efficiently with your customers, and help you grow your business. 

If you have separate business and personal phone numbers, you can have both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger installed on the same phone, and register them with different numbers.

In addition to the features available in WhatsApp Messenger, WhatsApp Business includes:

• BUSINESS PROFILE: Create a profile for your business to help your customers find valuable information — like your website, location, or contact information.

• BUSINESS MESSAGING TOOLS: Be more responsive to your customers by using Away messages to indicate when you're away or Greeting message to send your customers an introductory message when they first message you.

• LANDLINE/FIXED NUMBER SUPPORT: You can use WhatsApp Business with a landline (or fixed) phone number and your customers can message you on that number. During verification, select the “Call me” option to receive the code over a phone call.

• RUN BOTH WHATSAPP MESSENGER AND WHATSAPP BUSINESS: You can use both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger on the same phone, but each app must have its own unique phone number.

• WHATSAPP WEB: You can more efficiently respond to your customers right from your computer's browser.

WhatsApp Business is built on top of WhatsApp Messenger and includes all the features that you rely on, such as the ability to send multimedia, free calls*, free international messaging*, group chat, offline messages, and much more.

*Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details.

Note: once you restore chat backup from WhatsApp Messenger to WhatsApp Business, you will no longer be able to restore it back to WhatsApp Messenger. If you would like to go back, we recommend that you copy the WhatsApp Messenger backup on your phone to your computer before you start using WhatsApp Business.

One of the world's top 10 most downloaded apps with over 500 million active users.

FAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.

SYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.

UNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. 

SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. 

100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. 

POWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.

RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. 

FUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.

SIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.

PRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.

For those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.

We keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.","Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices.

Hinge is an inclusive dating app for people who want to get off dating apps for good. That means we’re for real people like you looking to chat, meet people, date and find relationship.
 
◼ 3 out of 4 people on Hinge want to go on a second date
◼ #1 mobile-first dating app mentioned in the New York Times wedding section
◼ Fastest growing dating app in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia
◼ Home of viral Voice Prompts
 
<b>Dating is hard. We try to make it a little less-hard.</b> ❤️‍🔥
The internet brings people and friends together, but we are here for those who want to meet people to fall in love with. Usually, digital dating puts matches before connecting, in person, where it counts. To change that, we built a dating app designed to be deleted. AKA, a dating app built to get you on actual dates with people who are more than us.
 
💌 We quickly learn your type and only introduce you to people we think would make a great date for you, increasing your chances to find love, not friends.
👋 Your answers to unique prompts help other people see beyond just a profile picture, making it easier to match, break the ice and start to chat and organize a date.
⭐ We get the conversation flowing - matches begin with a Like or Comment on a specific part of someone’s profile, giving the chat a smooth place to start and helps you assess chemistry. Could you be more than friends? Are they also looking for a relationship?
🔎 We actually check in to see how dates are going and follow up on how we can make better recommendations for future matches. We want you to fall in love and get off dating apps, not scroll through them forever.
 
<b>A dating app that is designed to be deleted</b>
🌐 We ask about religion, politics, future plans, etc. to help you share what is important to you even before starting a chat or meet someone on a date.
🌹 Roses kickstart potential matches, chats, dates, relationships and possibly love. 
🎯 Focused daily standouts help you meet the perfect match.
🔒 Our experience team is dedicated to maintaining a safe, inclusive space for online chats, offline dates, and connecting with people to fall in love with. 
🎙Voice prompts give you a better sense of people’s personalities off the app before meeting them on a date.
 
If you are tired of meeting people who only want to be friends, and want to power up your dating life, download Hinge. Our app is perfect for those ready to take a leap in the dating world. Whether you’re seeking love or to match and chat with new people, our features are designed to help you build a relationship that goes beyond just being friends.

We were using all the dating apps. It was always the same result–going on dates with people we had no chemistry with. We were exhausted from all the wasted time and effort. We made Boo because we knew there was a better way.

You can test the app for free with a limited questionnaire and purchase the desired content from the app. The app prepares perfectly for the theoretical boat piloting exam or the examination for the radio certificate.

*** LANGUAGE
The App is only available in german.

*** PAY TO USE / TRY FOR FREE
The following tickets are available as in-app purchases:
* Boat license questioners for coastal waters (CWM) called Sportbootführerschein See (Sbf See)

* License for Lake Constance, called Bodenseeschifferpatent (BSP)

*** KEY FEATURES

* Understand the answer: the questions are supplemented with many additional explanations and pictures
* Keyword-based learning: The relevant words are marked
* Learning pedagogy: card index system
* Additional explanations and additional illustrations

*** STRUCTURE & PHASE OF LEARNING

>>> LEARN (for long-term memory)
In the background, the app works with the Delius Klasing card index system developed for electronic media, inspired by Sebastian Leitner's learning method. This supports sustainable learning as with the use of a classic index card learning box system.
It can be learned both chapter by chapter and the entire catalog of questions. Statistics provide information about the learning progress at any time.
The most important keywords are highlighted in the answers to make learning easier.

>>> EXAM SIMULATION (knowledge check)
The official examination papers are displayed in the app. If you already have a driver's license or radio certificate and indicate this in the app, the number of questions is automatically reduced - just like in the real test.
You work under the same time limit as in the exam – a realistic exam simulation.

*** MORE FUNCTIONS

* the intelligent mock configuration compiles the catalog of questions automatically
* Cognitive association through additional illustrations
* Catalog of questions from the Verkehrsblatt (official source)
* Questions are grouped by topic
* Keyword search in questions and answers

<b>A safer online experience for kids</b>
We work hard to keep the videos on YouTube Kids family-friendly and use a mix of automated filters built by our engineering teams, human review, and feedback from parents to protect our youngest users online.

<b>Customize your child’s experience with Parental Controls
Limit screen time:</b> Set a time limit for how long your kids can watch and help encourage their transition from watching to doing.
<b>Keep up with what they watch:</b> Simply check the watch it again page and you’ll always know what they’ve watched and the newest interests they’re exploring.
<b>Blocking:</b> Don’t like a video? Block the video or whole channel, and never see it again.

It's hard to know how much or what kind of activity you need to stay healthy. That's why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.

Activities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You'll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO's recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.

Google Fit will also help you:

We use machine-learning algorithms to learn about your personal profile & tastes, delivering healthy meal plans to help you eat better and bring you one step closer to your fitness and nutrition goals. It's like having your own nutritionist in your pocket 24/7! 

Recommended meal plans include a mix of takeaways, ready-to-eat/cook meals, and recipes. With just one tap, Lifestyle AI can create a plan to eat what will be optimal for your body, up to two weeks in advance.

Here of some of the top features:

<b>Convenient Meal Plan Recommendations</b>
Lifestyle AI will deliver convenient food plan recommendations for each meal, dynamically adjusted to suit your profile. For every meal, we'll give you several options to choose from which are always tailored precisely to you and the progress you’re making towards your goals. Our meal recommendations give you recipes along with takeaways and ready meals you can get from retailers in your area. Or if you'd prefer, you can enter your own meals and they'll be recommended back to you when they suit you best. Forget having to rely only on time-consuming recipes to live a healthy lifestyle, we can integrate into even the busiest of schedules!

<b>Powered by Machine Learning</b>
Our set of advanced AI health algorithms will constantly be adjusting to bring you as close as possible to your goal. We'll also learn what you like along the way, so the process isn't an unsustainable diet but rather a lifestyle tweak with amazing results. Simply tell us your goal (e.g. lose 10 pounds by summer), and we'll handle the rest. All your nutrition will be planned out by the algorithm - every meal we give you will bring you one step closer!

<b>Calorie counter, food tracking, fitness tracking & more</b>
Lifestyle AI is also completely featured with everything you need in a calorie counter and fitness app. Manually add foods from our extensive database, create your own and track several macros and nutrients - all for free! We can also track your exercise habits, weight, and body fat, and then use this information to adjust your meal recommendations so that you're always getting the perfect fit.

<b>Other Features Include:</b>
- Meal recommendations with up to 15 different options per meal
- Automatic machine-learning driven nutritional management - our algorithm will determine your precise needs, with daily updates

We know that every family’s relationship with technology is unique, so we designed tools like Family Link that give you the flexibility to choose the right balance for your family, and help them create healthy digital habits. Family Link’s easy to use tools allow you to understand how your child is spending time on their device, see their device location, manage privacy settings, and more.


  With Family Link, you can:

  <b>Establish Digital Ground Rules</b>
  • Set screen time limits — Family Link lets you set downtime for your child’s device and time limits for apps, so you can help them find a healthy balance.
  • Guide them to age-appropriate content — Approve or block apps your child wants to download. Family Link also allows you to choose the right YouTube experience for your child: a supervised experience on YouTube, or YouTube Kids.

  <b>Manage and secure your child’s account</b>
  • Protect their privacy — Permissions management in Family Link allow you to make meaningful choices about your child’s data. View and manage permissions for websites and extensions accessed through Chrome as well as apps downloaded on your child’s device.
  • Secure their account — Family Link gives you access to manage your child's account and data settings. As a parent, you can help change or reset your child’s password if they forget it, edit their personal information or even delete their account if you feel necessary.

  <b>Stay connected on the go</b>
  • See where they are — It’s helpful to be able to find your family when they’re on the go. With Family Link, you can locate your children on one map, as long as they’re carrying their device.
  • Get notifications and alerts — Family Link delivers critical notifications including when your child arrives or leaves a certain location. You can also ring devices and view the device’s remaining battery life.


  <b>Important Information</b>

  • Family Link’s tools vary depending on your child’s device. See a list of compatible devices at https://families.google/familylink/device-compatibility/
  • While Family Link helps you manage your child's purchases and downloads from Google Play, they will not need approval to install app updates (including updates that expand permissions), apps you have previously approved, or apps that have been shared in Family Library. In addition, purchase approvals will apply only when your child makes a purchase through Google Play’s billing system and will not apply to purchases made through alternate billing systems. Parents should regularly review their child’s installed apps and app permissions in Family Link.
  • You should carefully review the apps on your child’s supervised device and disable those you don’t want them to use. Note that you may not be able to disable some pre-installed apps such as Play, Google, etc.
  • To see the location of your child or teen’s device, the device must be powered on, recently active, and connected to the internet through data or wifi.
  • Family Link parental controls are only available for supervised Google accounts. With supervised Google Accounts, children get access to Google products like Search, Chrome, and Gmail, and parents can set up basic digital ground rules to supervise them.
  • While Family Link provides tools to manage your child’s online experience and keep them safer online, it does not make the internet safe. Family Link can not determine the content on the internet, but it can give parents the opportunity to make decisions about how their child spends time on their device, and determine what path to online safety looks best for your family.","Google Family Link is a parental controls app that helps you keep your family safer online.

- “The best photo product on Earth” – The Verge
- “Google Photos is your new essential picture app” – Wired

The official Google Photos app is made for the way you take photos today and includes essential features like shared albums, automatic creations and an advanced editing suite. Additionally every Google Account comes with 15 GB of storage and you can choose to automatically back up all your photos and videos in High quality or Original quality. You can then access them from any connected device and on photos.google.com.

With the official app, you get:

15 GB OF STORAGE: Back up 15 GB of photos and videos and access them from any device and photos.google.com—your photos are safe, secure, and private to you. All photos and videos you back up in high quality before June 1, 2021 will not count toward your Google Account storage.

FREE UP SPACE: Never worry about running out of space on your phone again. Photos that are safely backed up can be removed from your device's storage in just a tap.

NO ADS: Google Photos doesn't sell your photos, videos, or personal information to anyone and we don't use your photos and videos for advertising.

FAST AND POWERFUL SEARCH: Your photos are now searchable by the people, places and things in them — no tagging required.

GOOGLE LENS: Search the hard-to-describe and get stuff done, right from a photo. Copy and translate text, identify plants and animals, add events to your calendar, find products online, and more.

ADVANCED EDITING SUITE: Transform photos with a tap. Use intuitive and powerful photo editing tools to apply content-aware filters, adjust lighting, and more.

AUTOMATIC CREATIONS: Bring photos to life with automatically created movies, collages, animations, panoramas, and more from your photos. Or easily create them yourself.

SHARING SUGGESTIONS: With smart sharing suggestions, giving your friends the photos you took of them is painless. And they can add their photos, too, so you’ll finally get the photos you’re actually in.

LIVE ALBUMS: Select the people and pets you want to see and Google Photos will automatically add photos of them as you take them, no manual updates needed.*

PHOTO BOOKS: Create a photo book in just minutes from your phone or computer. You can also see suggested photo books based on your best shots from a trip or period of time.*

SEND PHOTOS IN SECONDS: Instantly share photos with any contact, email, or phone number.

SHARED LIBRARIES: Grant a trusted person access to all of your photos.

You can also upgrade storage for your Google Account, used for Original Quality photos and videos by subscribing to Google One. Subscriptions start at $1.99/month for 100 GB in the US. Pricing and availability can vary by region.

<b>OnePlus, Pixel and Xiaomi users</b> - you need one of the launchers below because your stock launcher does not support third-party icon packs. I recommend <b>Nova</b> - it's free!

<b>Samsung users</b> - if you are on Android 12 with OneUI 4.0 (or newer), you'll be able to apply icons with the (free) Samsung app Theme Park. OneUI 3 and lower doesn't support icon packs but you could switch to an alternative launcher from the list below:

To apply the icon pack, you must have one of these <b>launchers installed</b>:
Action • ADW • APEX • BlackBerry • CM Theme • ColorOS (12+) • Flick • Go EX • Holo • Holo HD • Hyperion • KISS • Lawnchair • LG Home • Lucid • Microsoft • Neo • Niagara • Nougat • <b>Nova</b> (recommended) • OneUI 4.0 (with Theme Park) • POCO (not MIUI!) • Posidon • Smart • Solo • Square

5 free icon requests are included in the app. I draw 100-200 new icons each month based on the most popular ones. If you want be absolutely sure your app is included in the following month's update, or if you've run out of requests, you can buy additional request packages (1, 5, 10 or 20 icons) right from within the app.

I draw all icons pixel by pixel on a tiny 20x20 pixel canvas and then upscale them so they look amazingly crisp on your homescreen or app drawer. You can be sure I'm using all my skill to make cute and readable icons you'll enjoy looking at!

- “The best photo product on Earth” – The Verge
- “Google Photos is your new essential picture app” – Wired

The official Google Photos app is made for the way you take photos today and includes essential features like shared albums, automatic creations and an advanced editing suite. Additionally every Google Account comes with 15 GB of storage and you can choose to automatically back up all your photos and videos in High quality or Original quality. You can then access them from any connected device and on photos.google.com.

With the official app, you get:

15 GB OF STORAGE: Back up 15 GB of photos and videos and access them from any device and photos.google.com—your photos are safe, secure, and private to you. All photos and videos you back up in high quality before June 1, 2021 will not count toward your Google Account storage.

FREE UP SPACE: Never worry about running out of space on your phone again. Photos that are safely backed up can be removed from your device's storage in just a tap.

NO ADS: Google Photos doesn't sell your photos, videos, or personal information to anyone and we don't use your photos and videos for advertising.

FAST AND POWERFUL SEARCH: Your photos are now searchable by the people, places and things in them — no tagging required.

GOOGLE LENS: Search the hard-to-describe and get stuff done, right from a photo. Copy and translate text, identify plants and animals, add events to your calendar, find products online, and more.

ADVANCED EDITING SUITE: Transform photos with a tap. Use intuitive and powerful photo editing tools to apply content-aware filters, adjust lighting, and more.

AUTOMATIC CREATIONS: Bring photos to life with automatically created movies, collages, animations, panoramas, and more from your photos. Or easily create them yourself.

SHARING SUGGESTIONS: With smart sharing suggestions, giving your friends the photos you took of them is painless. And they can add their photos, too, so you’ll finally get the photos you’re actually in.

LIVE ALBUMS: Select the people and pets you want to see and Google Photos will automatically add photos of them as you take them, no manual updates needed.*

PHOTO BOOKS: Create a photo book in just minutes from your phone or computer. You can also see suggested photo books based on your best shots from a trip or period of time.*

SEND PHOTOS IN SECONDS: Instantly share photos with any contact, email, or phone number.

SHARED LIBRARIES: Grant a trusted person access to all of your photos.

You can also upgrade storage for your Google Account, used for Original Quality photos and videos by subscribing to Google One. Subscriptions start at $1.99/month for 100 GB in the US. Pricing and availability can vary by region.

Reddit is a social network with something for everyone: trending topics, diverse discussions, and engaging communities. 

Redditors have authentic and interesting conversations around all sorts of curated content. You’ll find gaming communities, bloggers, meme-makers, fandoms, travel enthusiasts, support groups, AI forums, news junkies, artists, and creators of all types.

Reddit has over 100,000 online communities (forums where members post and comment) dedicated to specific topics. Some of the most popular communities are:
* r/AskReddit, where users can ask and answer questions
* r/funny, which is full of humorous content
* r/science, for scientific discussions and news
* r/gifs, with funny animated gifs for your viewing pleasure

On Reddit you’ll find:
* Thousands of community groups
Breaking news, social media trends, sports highlights, TV fan theories, open AI discussions and personalized content, there's a community for everyone.

* Loads of laughs
Find memes, oddly satisfying videos, funny cat videos, and more to help you lose track of time

* AMAs, or ""Ask Me Anything""
Celebrities, politicians, and experts answer questions from users.

* The best discussions on any topic
Reddit’s discussion threads are where community members jump in with humor and insights for just about anything; pop culture, sports, entertainment, or financial advice. Discussions on Reddit are so rich it’s no surprise they’re a top training source for AI models like ChatGPT.

* Get answers to anonymous questions 
Why ask ChatGPT when all your answers are already here? Ask communities anything you want. Ask questions on relationships, mental health, parenting, career help, fitness plans, and more.

* Anonymous profiles so you can do YOU
Connect with people about any topic, join interactive community groups, and chat with other redditors, all anonymously.

Voting and Karma:

Instead of likes and hearts, Reddit’s social network runs on upvotes or downvotes. Voting on posts and comments increase or decrease the creator’s karma, and helps popular and relevant posts rise to the top, while filtering out low-quality or irrelevant posts.

While karma doesn't directly impact your ability to use Reddit, more karma can increase posts’ visibility and help you get noticed. Some communities require karma to post or comment, which helps prevent spam or low-quality content.

Reddit Premium:

Purchase Reddit Premium to enjoy an ads-free experience and access to premium avatar gear, r/lounge, custom app icons, and more.

Payment will be charged on a recurring monthly or annual basis to your Google Play account. Your monthly or annual Premium subscription will automatically renew unless you cancel at least 24 hours before your subscription ends. Cancel anytime in your device’s Account Settings. No partial refunds.

If you have any problems with the app, get support at RedditHelp.com","Welcome to Reddit, the heart of the internet.<br><br>Reddit is a social network with something for everyone: trending topics, diverse discussions, and engaging communities. <br><br>Redditors have authentic and interesting conversations around all sorts of curated content. You’ll find gaming communities, bloggers, meme-makers, fandoms, travel enthusiasts, support groups, AI forums, news junkies, artists, and creators of all types.<br><br>Reddit has over 100,000 online communities (forums where members post and comment) dedicated to specific topics. Some of the most popular communities are:<br>* r/AskReddit, where users can ask and answer questions<br>* r/funny, which is full of humorous content<br>* r/science, for scientific discussions and news<br>* r/gifs, with funny animated gifs for your viewing pleasure<br><br>On Reddit you’ll find:<br>* Thousands of community groups<br>Breaking news, social media trends, sports highlights, TV fan theories, open AI discussions and personalized content, there&#39;s a community for everyone.<br><br>* Loads of laughs<br>Find memes, oddly satisfying videos, funny cat videos, and more to help you lose track of time<br><br>* AMAs, or &quot;Ask Me Anything&quot;<br>Celebrities, politicians, and experts answer questions from users.<br><br>* The best discussions on any topic<br>Reddit’s discussion threads are where community members jump in with humor and insights for just about anything; pop culture, sports, entertainment, or financial advice. Discussions on Reddit are so rich it’s no surprise they’re a top training source for AI models like ChatGPT.<br><br>* Get answers to anonymous questions <br>Why ask ChatGPT when all your answers are already here? Ask communities anything you want. Ask questions on relationships, mental health, parenting, career help, fitness plans, and more.<br><br>* Anonymous profiles so you can do YOU<br>Connect with people about any topic, join interactive community groups, and chat with other redditors, all anonymously.<br><br>Voting and Karma:<br><br>Instead of likes and hearts, Reddit’s social network runs on upvotes or downvotes. Voting on posts and comments increase or decrease the creator’s karma, and helps popular and relevant posts rise to the top, while filtering out low-quality or irrelevant posts.<br><br>While karma doesn&#39;t directly impact your ability to use Reddit, more karma can increase posts’ visibility and help you get noticed. Some communities require karma to post or comment, which helps prevent spam or low-quality content.<br><br>Reddit Premium:<br><br>Purchase Reddit Premium to enjoy an ads-free experience and access to premium avatar gear, r/lounge, custom app icons, and more.<br><br>Payment will be charged on a recurring monthly or annual basis to your Google Play account.

You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.

Getting started with multi-factor authentication
Multi factor authentication (MFA) or two factor authentication (2FA) provides a second layer of security. When logging in with multi-factor authentication, you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The one-time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one-time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.

Getting started with passwordless
Use your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.

Getting started with autofill
Microsoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.

Microsoft personal, work or school accounts
Sometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.

Optional Access permissions: 
Microsoft Authenticator includes the following optional access permissions. All these require user consent. If you choose to not grant these optional access permissions, you can still use Microsoft Authenticator for other services that do not require such permission. For more information see https://aka.ms/authappfaq
Accessibility Service:  Used to optionally support Autofill on more apps and sites.
Location: Sometimes your organization wants to know your location before allowing you to access certain resources. The app will request this permission only if your organization has a policy requiring location.
Camera: Used to scan QR codes when you add a work, school, or non-Microsoft account.
Read the contents of your storage: This permission is only used when you report a technical problem through the app settings. Some information from your storage is collected to diagnose the issue.","Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill.

<b>How it works</b>
Most aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of over 20,000 ground stations around the world to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage in North America is also supplemented by real-time radar data. Coverage is variable and subject to change at any time.

Just start the app, and your location pops up with animated live radar, with radar loop lengths of up to two hours.  This basic functionality provides the quickest way to get a fast snapshot of the weather on-the-go, and it's what has made MyRadar so successful over the years.  Check your phone and get an instant assessment of the weather that will impact your day.

In addition to the live radar, MyRadar has an ever-increasing list of weather and environmentally-related data layers that you can overlay on top of the map;  our animated winds layer shows a breathtaking visual representation of both surface winds and winds at the jetstream level; the frontal boundaries layer shows high and low pressure systems as well as frontal boundaries themselves; the earthquakes layer is a great way to stay on top of the latest reports on seismic activity, completely customizable as to severity and time; our hurricane layer allows users to stay on top of the latest tropical storm and hurricane activity throughout the world; the aviation layer overlays AIRMETs, SIGMETs and other aviation-related data, including the ability to track flights and display their IFR flight plans and paths, and the ""wildfires"" layer allows users to stay abreast of the latest fire activity around the United States.

In addition to the data layers, MyRadar has the ability to send weather and environmental alerts, including alerts from the National Weather Center, such as Tornado and Severe Weather alerts.  MyRadar includes the ability to receive alerts based off of Tropical  Storm and Hurricane activity;  you can configure the app to send you an alert any time a tropical storm or hurricane forms, or is upgraded or downgraded.

One of the most useful features in MyRadar is the ability to provide advanced rain alerts;  our patent-pending process for predicting hyper-local rainfall is the most accurate in the industry.  Instead of having to constantly check the app, MyRadar will send you an alert up to an hour in advance as to when the rain will arrive at your current location, down to the minute, including details on intensity and duration.  These alerts can be a life saver when you're on-the-go and don't always have time to check the weather - our systems will proactively do the work for you and let you know in advance before the rain hits.

All of the weather and environmental data represented on MyRadar is displayed on our custom mapping system, developed in-house.  This mapping system uses your devices GPU, which makes it incredibly fast and speedy.  When you're looking for quick weather information on-the-go, that makes a huge difference.  The map has the standard pinch/zoom capability which allows you to smoothly zoom and pan around the United States and the rest of the world to see what the weather is like anywhere on the planet.

In addition to the free features of the app, the premium upgrade is available, including real-time hurricane tracking - great for the start of hurricane season.  This feature provides additional data above and beyond the free version, including the cone of probability for tropical storm/hurricane forecast tracks, and also includes a detailed synopsis from the National Hurricane Center.  The premium upgrade also include the professional radar pack, which allows greater detail of radar from individual stations.  Users can select individual radar stations around the US, select the radar tilt angle, and also change the radar product being displayed, including base reflectivity and wind velocity - great for experienced weather buffs looks to stay on top of possible tornado formation.

MyRadar is also available for WearOS devices - try on your smartwatch!
